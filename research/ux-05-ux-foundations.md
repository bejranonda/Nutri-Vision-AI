**Health Profile**:
- Goal: Prevent diabetes (father has Type 2)
- Current: Eats out 5-6 days/week

- Social validation (share progress)

**Frustrations with Current Apps**:
- MyFitnessPal: "Takes forever to log Pad Krapow"
- Manual entry: "I forget what I ate by dinner"
- Western apps: "Don't understand Thai portions"

**Jobs to Be Done**:
- ✅ "When I eat Thai food, I want to know its health impact immediately"
- ✅ "When I'm choosing lunch, I want to make informed decisions"
- ✅ "When I track nutrition, I want it to take <30 seconds total"
- ✅ "When I see progress, I want to share it with friends"

**UX Priorities**:
1. Speed (under 30 seconds per meal log)
2. Visual clarity (understand scores at a glance)
3. Social sharing (Instagram, LINE)
4. Blood sugar info (diabetes prevention)

**Success Scenario**:
> Ploy is at a street food stall deciding between Pad Thai and Som Tam. She opens NutriVision, scans both options in 10 seconds, sees Som Tam has better scores (especially blood sugar: 88 vs. 72). She chooses Som Tam, feels empowered by the knowledge, and shares her healthy choice on Instagram Stories with NutriVision's share feature.
