## 4️⃣ Product Concept & Feature Direction

### 4.1 Core Product Concept

**Product Vision:**

"NutriVision AI empowers Thai people to make informed, healthy food choices through AI-powered nutrition intelligence specifically designed for Thai cuisine, culture, and lifestyle - democratizing personalized nutrition coaching through accessible technology."

**Strategic Product Purpose:**

Unlike generic Western nutrition apps that fail to understand Thai food complexity, NutriVision AI is purpose-built to solve the **#1 challenge** identified in market research: **AI apps systematically fail on Asian cuisine recognition and nutritional accuracy.**

**Core Problem Solved:**

Thai people want to eat healthy while enjoying their cultural cuisine, but face:
1. **Recognition Gap:** No apps accurately identify Thai dishes
2. **Database Gap:** Western food databases don't include Thai ingredients/recipes
3. **Cultural Gap:** Generic advice doesn't account for rice-heavy Thai diet
4. **Blood Sugar Crisis:** Rising diabetes in Thailand requires Thai food-specific glycemic management

**Core Solution:**

AI-powered nutrition analysis built on:
1. **Thai Food Mastery:** 1,000+ recipe database, expanding to 1M+ images
2. **8-Dimension Nutrition Scoring:** Proprietary system prioritizing blood sugar impact
3. **Cultural Intelligence:** Eating sequence education, traditional wisdom + modern science
4. **Conversational AI Coach:** Thai/English fluent nutritionist in your pocket

### 4.2 Minimum Viable Value (MVV) vs Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

**Philosophy: Value-First Launch**

Research shows that MVPs focused solely on "viable" often fail because they don't deliver sufficient value. We're adopting **Minimum Viable Value (MVV)** approach: the smallest feature set that delivers meaningful, complete value to users.

#### MVV Core Features (Launch Essential - MUST HAVE)

**1. AI Food Recognition & Scanning**

**User Story:** "As a Thai person, I want to snap a photo of my meal and instantly know its nutritional content, so that I can make informed food choices without manual effort."

**Features:**
- Camera integration with real-time capture
- Google Gemini Vision API integration
- Thai dish recognition (target: 90%+ accuracy)
- Ingredient breakdown for mixed dishes
- Portion size estimation
- Nutrition facts: calories, macros (protein, carbs, fat), fiber
- Save scanned meals to history

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- <3 seconds from photo to results
- 90%+ user confirmation rate ("Is this correct?")
- Works on 100+ most common Thai dishes
- Handles restaurant food, street food, home-cooked meals

**Why MVV:** This is the core "aha moment" - proves NutriVision can do what competitors can't (Thai food recognition). Without high accuracy here, product fails.

**2. 8-Dimension Nutrition Scoring**

**User Story:** "As a health-conscious person, I want to quickly understand if a meal is healthy, so that I can make better choices beyond just calories."

**Scoring Dimensions:**
1. **Blood Sugar Impact (0-100):** Glycemic load, fiber, critical for Thai diet
2. **Gut Health (0-100):** Fiber, prebiotics, probiotics, fermented foods
3. **Inflammation (0-100):** Omega-3/6 ratio, antioxidants, anti-inflammatory ingredients
4. **Nutrient Density (0-100):** Nutrients per calorie (ANDI score)
5. **Processing Level (0-100):** NOVA classification, additives, whole food %
6. **Protein Quality (0-100):** Amino acid profile, quantity, source (PDCAAS)
7. **Micronutrient Coverage (0-100):** % RDI for 12 key vitamins/minerals
8. **Overall Health Score (0-100):** Weighted average personalized to user goals

**Features:**
- Visual score display (color-coded: Green 80-100, Yellow 60-79, Orange 40-59, Red 0-39)
- One-tap score explanation
- Comparison: "This meal vs. your average"
- Tips for improvement: "Add vegetables for better gut health score"

**Why MVV:** Proprietary differentiation, provides actionable insights beyond calorie counting, addresses Thai diet-specific needs (blood sugar).

**3. Personalized User Profile**

**User Story:** "As a user with specific health goals, I want the app to personalize recommendations based on my profile, so that I get relevant, tailored advice."

**Profile Fields:**
- Demographics: Age, gender, location
- Biometrics: Height, weight, activity level
- Health Goals: Weight loss, weight gain, maintain, blood sugar control, muscle gain, general wellness
- Dietary Preferences: Vegetarian, pescatarian, flexitarian, halal, no restrictions
- Health Conditions: Diabetes, pre-diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, none (optional)
- Allergies & Restrictions: Shellfish, peanuts, gluten, etc.

**Features:**
- Guided onboarding flow (complete in 2 minutes)
- Daily calorie and macro targets auto-calculated
- Personalized scoring weights (e.g., blood sugar impact weighted higher for diabetics)
- Profile editing anytime

**Why MVV:** Personalization is table stakes for 2025 health apps. Without it, we're just another calorie counter.

**4. AI Nutrition Coach (Chat)**

**User Story:** "As someone confused about nutrition, I want to ask questions to an expert and get immediate, personalized answers in Thai or English."

**Features:**
- Conversational AI powered by Google Gemini
- Thai and English language support

- Common queries: "Is this healthy?", "What should I eat for dinner?", "Why did I gain weight this week?"
- Nutrition education: Explains concepts in simple language
- Chat history saved

**Free Tier:** 5 messages/month
**Premium:** Unlimited chat

**Why MVV:** Human coaching is expensive ($100-300/session with nutritionist). AI coaching at scale is key differentiator and conversion driver.

**5. Meal History & Tracking**

**User Story:** "As someone tracking nutrition, I want to see my eating patterns over time, so that I can identify what works and what doesn't."

**Features:**
- Calendar view: Daily, weekly, monthly

- Meal details: Tap to review any past meal
- Trends: Weight, scores over time
- Streak tracking: Days logged

**Free Tier:** 7 days history
**Premium:** Unlimited history, export

**Why MVV:** Behavior change requires feedback loops. Without tracking, users can't see progress, retention drops.

#### Scalability Considerations

**Image Processing:**
- **Challenge:** Gemini Vision API costs scale with usage ($0.002-0.005 per image)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Months 1-12: Accept API costs as user acquisition investment
  - Month 12+: Train lightweight on-device model for top 100 Thai dishes (reduce API calls by 60%)
  - Year 2: Hybrid approach - on-device for common, cloud for complex

**Database Performance:**
- **Challenge:** Meal history grows linearly with users
- **Mitigation:**
  - Partition by user_id for efficient queries
  - Archive meals older than 2 years to cold storage
  - Implement read replicas for analytics queries

**API Rate Limiting:**
- **Challenge:** Free tier abuse, denial of service
- **Mitigation:**
  - Redis-based rate limiting: 10 scans/day for free, unlimited for premium
  - IP-based rate limiting for API endpoints
  - Cloudflare DDoS protection

**Real-Time Features:**
- **Challenge:** AI chat requires low latency
- **Mitigation:**
  - WebSocket connections for chat (FastAPI supports)
  - Redis pub/sub for real-time updates
  - Streaming responses from Gemini API

#### Data Privacy & Security

**PDPA Compliance:**
- **Encryption:** All data encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3)
- **Consent:** Explicit opt-in for health data collection, granular consent management
- **Data Minimization:** Only collect necessary data for core features
- **Right to Erasure:** User can delete account and all data within 30 days
- **Data Breach Notification:** Automated system to notify users within 72 hours
- **Data Export:** Users can export all their data (JSON, CSV)

**Security Best Practices:**
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens with refresh mechanism, 2FA for sensitive actions
- **Password:** Bcrypt hashing, minimum complexity requirements
- **SQL Injection:** Parameterized queries via SQLAlchemy ORM
- **XSS Protection:** Content Security Policy (CSP), input sanitization
- **CORS:** Whitelist only trusted domains
- **API Security:** API key authentication for third-party integrations

**Regulatory Positioning:**
- **NOT a Medical Device:** Position as "nutrition information and education tool"
- **Avoid Medical Claims:** No language like "treats", "cures", "diagnoses", "prevents disease"
- **Educational Framing:** "Helps you make informed food choices", "Provides nutrition insights"
- **Disclaimer:** Clear disclaimer that app is not a substitute for medical advice
