### 6.2 Heuristic Evaluation (Nielsen's 10 Principles)

**Heuristic #1: Visibility of System Status**
- ✅ **Current:** Loading spinner shows progress
- ⚠️ **Issue:** Indeterminate spinner (user doesn't know how long)
- ✅ **Fix:** Progress bar with percentage (25% → 50% → 75% → 100%)

**Heuristic #2: Match Between System and Real World**
- ✅ **Strength:** Thai language, measurements, food names
- ✅ **Strength:** Familiar LINE integration
- ⚠️ **Issue:** Some nutrition terms may be too technical
- ✅ **Fix:** Plain Thai language ("น้ำตาลในเลือด" not "Glycemic Index")

**Heuristic #3: User Control and Freedom**
- ⚠️ **Issue:** Can't undo after adding meal to log
- ✅ **Fix:** Add undo button (5-second window)
- ⚠️ **Issue:** Can't edit AI scan results easily
- ✅ **Fix:** Prominent "Edit" button on results screen

**Heuristic #4: Consistency and Standards**
- ✅ **Strength:** Bottom nav consistent across screens
- ⚠️ **Issue:** No documented design system (inconsistency risk as team scales)
- ✅ **Fix:** Create design system documentation (P1)

**Heuristic #5: Error Prevention**
- ✅ **Strength:** No complex forms (LINE login reduces errors)
- ⚠️ **Issue:** Users may scan non-food items (photo of menu, etc.)
- ✅ **Fix:** Add "Is this food?" confirmation if AI confidence <70%

**Heuristic #6: Recognition Rather Than Recall**
- ✅ **Strength:** Recent scans visible on dashboard
- ✅ **Strength:** Suggested AI coach questions (no need to think of what to ask)
- ⚠️ **Issue:** Recipe search requires remembering dish names
- ✅ **Fix:** Visual browse (photos), autocomplete suggestions

**Heuristic #7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**
- ✅ **Strength:** FAB provides shortcut for power users
- ✅ **Strength:** Swipe gestures for common actions
- ⚠️ **Issue:** No keyboard shortcuts (less relevant for mobile)
- ✅ **Future:** Voice commands ("Scan food", "Show recipes")

**Heuristic #8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**
- ✅ **Strength:** Clean Tailwind CSS design
- ⚠️ **Issue:** Scan results may show too much data at once (8 dimensions)
- ✅ **Fix:** Progressive disclosure (overall score → highlights → full details)

**Heuristic #9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors**
- ⚠️ **Issue:** Generic error messages ("Error 400")
- ✅ **Fix:** Helpful, human error messages:
  - ❌ "Error 404"
  - ✅ "เราหาสูตรนี้ไม่เจอ ลองค้นหาอย่างอื่นไหม?" (We couldn't find that recipe. Try searching for something else?)

**Heuristic #10: Help and Documentation**
- ⚠️ **Issue:** No in-app help or tutorials (beyond onboarding)
- ✅ **Fix:** Add:
  - Contextual tooltips (first 3 uses)
  - Help icon in top bar → FAQ/tutorials
  - AI coach can answer "how to" questions

**Overall Heuristic Score:** 7/10 (Good foundation, needs polish in error handling, help system, progressive disclosure)
