### 3.3 Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Definition

**MVP Scope (Already Built):**

✅ **Must-Have Features (Launch Ready):**
- AI food recognition (Thai dishes)
- 8-dimension nutrition scoring
- 1,000 Thai recipes database
- AI nutrition chat (Thai/English)
- User authentication (email, Google, LINE, Facebook)
- Free/Premium/Family subscription tiers
- Payment processing (PromptPay, credit card)
- Meal tracking and history
- Mobile-first PWA

**MVP Success Criteria (Month 1-3):**
- 500 beta users complete onboarding
- 90% food recognition accuracy on top 100 Thai dishes
- 3-5 second scan-to-result time
- 4.0+ star rating
- 60%+ first scan completion rate
- 4%+ free-to-paid conversion
- <3% payment failure rate

**Post-MVP Immediate Priorities (Months 1-3):**
1. LINE Official Account integration
2. Gamification (streaks, points, badges)
3. Social sharing (Instagram/TikTok)
4. Referral program
5. Push notification system
6. Onboarding A/B testing

### 3.4 Minimum Viable Value (MVV) vs MVP

**MVV = Smallest Feature Set That Delivers Transformational Value**

Traditional MVP thinking: "What's the minimum we can build?"
MVV thinking: "What's the minimum that actually changes behavior?"

**NutriVision MVV:**

**Core Value:** *"I can finally understand what I'm eating (Thai food) and make better choices without effort."*

**MVV Feature Set:**
1. **Instant Thai food recognition** (saves 5+ min/meal vs manual entry) ✅ Built
2. **Blood sugar impact score** (addresses #1 Thai health concern) ✅ Built
3. **Simple health score (0-100)** (easy to understand, actionable) ✅ Built
4. **Thai language support** (accessible to 52M Thais) ✅ Built
5. **Free tier** (try before buy, low barrier) ✅ Built

**What's Notably NOT in MVV:**
- ❌ All 8 dimensions (nice-to-have, not core value)
- ❌ Meal planning (can add later)
- ❌ Community features (retention, not acquisition)
- ❌ Recipe creator (content moat, not immediate value)

**Insight:** Our current MVP exceeds MVV, which is good for differentiation but risks complexity. Post-launch, consider "MVV Fast Mode" for ultra-simple onboarding.

---

## 4. FEATURE PRIORITIZATION & IMPACT ANALYSIS

### 4.1 Prioritization Framework Selection

**We use a multi-framework approach:**

1. **MoSCoW** - Initial categorization (Must/Should/Could/Won't)
2. **RICE** - Scoring for objective comparison (Reach × Impact × Confidence / Effort)
3. **Kano Model** - Customer satisfaction classification (Must-Have / Performance / Delighter)

- ❌ Water intake tracking (too basic, not differentiating)
- ❌ Sleep tracking (out of scope)
- ❌ Medication reminders (regulatory risk)

### 4.3 RICE Scoring Model (Top 20 Features)

**RICE Formula:** `(Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort = RICE Score`

**Scoring Scale:**
- **Reach:** # of users impacted per quarter (e.g., 50 = 50% of user base)
- **Impact:** 3 = Massive, 2 = High, 1 = Medium, 0.5 = Low, 0.25 = Minimal
- **Confidence:** 100% = High data, 80% = Medium, 50% = Low
- **Effort:** Person-months (0.5 = 2 weeks, 1 = 1 month, 2 = 2 months, etc.)

### 4.4 Kano Model Analysis

**Kano Model categorizes features by customer satisfaction impact:**

**MUST-HAVE FEATURES** (Basic/Threshold)
*Customers expect these. Presence doesn't increase satisfaction, but absence causes major dissatisfaction.*

| Feature | Rationale | Customer Reaction if Missing |
|---------|-----------|----------------------------|
| Food recognition accuracy (90%+) | Core value proposition | "This app doesn't even work" |
| Thai language support | 50%+ of users only speak Thai | "Not for me" (abandonment) |
| Free tier | Industry standard, try-before-buy | "Why should I pay without trying?" |
| Fast scan speed (<5 sec) | Impatience threshold | "Too slow, I'll just guess" |
| Privacy/security (PDPA compliant) | Legal requirement + trust | "I don't trust this app with my data" |
| Basic nutrition info (calories, macros) | Expected functionality | "What's the point of this app?" |

---

**PERFORMANCE FEATURES** (One-Dimensional)
*Satisfaction scales linearly with feature sophistication. More = Better.*

| Feature | Low Performance (Dissatisfaction) | High Performance (Satisfaction) |
|---------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Food database size | "Too many dishes not recognized" | "It knows every Thai dish I try!" |
| Number of recipes | "Only 50 recipes? That's nothing." | "1,000+ recipes - I'll never get bored!" |
| AI chat responsiveness | "The AI doesn't understand me" | "The AI actually gives great advice!" |
| Personalization accuracy | "Generic advice, not for me" | "It's like it knows exactly what I need!" |
| Dashboard insights | "Just basic charts" | "Wow, I can see trends I never noticed!" |

---

**DELIGHTERS** (Attractive/Excitement)
*Customers don't expect these. Presence creates delight and loyalty. Absence doesn't cause dissatisfaction.*

| Feature | Surprise Factor | Emotional Response |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Eating sequence education (70% blood sugar reduction) | "I never knew this!" | "This is life-changing for my diabetes risk!" |
| Thai food cultural insights (festival foods, traditions) | "No app has this!" | "Finally someone understands Thai culture!" |
| Gamification (streaks, badges, levels) | "Nutrition tracking is fun?" | "I'm addicted to my 30-day streak!" |
| Voice food logging in Thai | "I can just talk to it?" | "This is so convenient!" |
| Family health dashboard | "Track my whole family?" | "Perfect for managing everyone's health!" |
| CGM integration (future) | "Real-time blood sugar?" | "This is the future of nutrition!" |
| AR scanning (future) | "Point and see nutrition?" | "This feels like sci-fi!" |

**Strategic Insight:** Focus development on:
1. **Must-Haves first** (prevent dissatisfaction)
2. **Delighters second** (create wow moments for virality and differentiation)
3. **Performance features third** (incremental improvements)

**Rationale:** Must-Haves prevent churn. Delighters drive word-of-mouth growth and brand love. Performance features are continuous improvement.

## ROADMAP SUMMARY

### Key Strategic Recommendations

1. **Focus on Onboarding** (RICE Score 400)
   - 60%+ first scan completion is critical for all downstream metrics
   - A/B test: tutorial skip vs. guided tour, gamified vs. simple

2. **LINE Integration is Priority #1** (RICE Score 240)
   - 52M users, 80-90% open rates, critical for Thai market success
   - Launch within Month 1-2, not later

3. **Add Student Package** (NEW RECOMMENDATION)
   - THB 999/year (50% off), targets 30% of market (Gen Z)
   - Verify with .ac.th email or age, annual-only (resists monthly)

4. **Delay Add-Ons Until Product-Market Fit** (Month 6+)
   - Avoid complexity and distraction during critical validation phase
   - Exception: Can soft-launch Recipe Packs in Month 3-4 if demand signals strong

5. **B2B is Strategic But Not Urgent** (Month 6-12 Launch OK)
   - Build B2C case studies first to sell to corporate buyers
   - Focus on "Small Business" tier first (easier sales cycle)

6. **Invest in Delighters for Differentiation**
   - Eating sequence education (blood sugar 70% reduction)
   - Thai cultural insights (festival foods, traditions)
   - Gamification (streaks, badges) for habit formation
   - These create word-of-mouth and brand love

7. **Plan for Apple Health+ Competition** (Expected 2026)
   - Build strong community and brand love before iOS 19.4 launch
   - Emphasize Thai specialization (Apple will be generic)
   - Consider partnership with Apple Health data sync (don't compete, integrate)
