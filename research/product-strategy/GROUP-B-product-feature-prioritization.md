## 1. RICE Scoring Model

### 1.1 RICE Framework Explanation

**RICE** = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

- **Reach:** How many users will this feature affect per time period? (e.g., per month)
- **Impact:** How much will this feature impact each user? (Scale: 0.25 = minimal, 0.5 = low, 1.0 = medium, 2.0 = high, 3.0 = massive)
- **Confidence:** How confident are we in our estimates? (Scale: 50% = low, 80% = medium, 100% = high)
- **Effort:** How many person-months will this take? (Engineering + design + testing)

## 3. Kano Model (Customer Satisfaction Analysis)

### 3.1 Kano Model Framework

The Kano Model categorizes features based on how they affect customer satisfaction:

- **Basic Needs (Threshold):** Must-haves. Customers expect these. Absence causes dissatisfaction.
- **Performance Needs (Linear):** More is better. Satisfaction increases with quality/quantity.
- **Excitement/Delight Needs:** Unexpected features that create joy. Absence doesn't cause dissatisfaction, but presence creates delight.
- **Indifferent:** Customers don't care either way.
- **Reverse:** Some customers prefer absence (e.g., ads, complex features).

### 3.2 Nutri-Vision AI Feature Categorization

**BASIC NEEDS (Must-Have - Table Stakes)**

| Feature | Rationale | Risk if Missing |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Thai Food Database (1000+)** | Core value proposition | Critical - users will churn immediately if not present |
| **AI Food Recognition** | Expected from "AI nutrition app" | High - competitors have this |
| **8-D Nutrition Scores** | Differentiator but expected | High - core IP, users expect detailed info |
| **Calorie & Macro Tracking** | Industry standard | Medium - users compare to MyFitnessPal |
| **User Authentication** | Security/privacy expectation | Critical - regulatory requirement |
| **Thai Language Support** | Target market requirement | Critical - English-only would fail in Thailand |
| **Mobile Optimization** | Mobile-first market (Thailand) | Critical - desktop-first would fail |
| **PDPA Compliance** | Regulatory requirement | Critical - legal risk |

**PERFORMANCE NEEDS (More = Better Satisfaction)**

| Feature | Customer Satisfaction Curve | Target Metric |
|---------|----------------------------|---------------|
| **Food Recognition Accuracy** | Linear (80% → 90% → 95%) | >90% accuracy target |
| **Database Completeness** | Linear (1000 → 1500 → 2000 recipes) | 1500+ by Month 12 |
| **AI Response Speed** | Linear (5s → 2s → <1s) | <2s target |
| **App Load Time** | Linear (5s → 3s → <2s) | <3s on 4G connection |
| **Recipe Quality** | Linear (nutritionist-verified, photos, variations) | 100% verified by Month 12 |
| **Personalization Accuracy** | Linear (generic → tailored → predictive) | 80% user satisfaction with recommendations |
| **Scan Limit (Free Tier)** | Linear (5 → 10 → 15 scans/month) | 10 scans optimal (conversion trigger) |

**EXCITEMENT/DELIGHT NEEDS (Wow Factors)**

| Feature | Delight Factor | Strategic Value |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Voice Logging** | High - "I can log while driving!" | Addresses logging fatigue, unique in market |
| **Eating Sequence Reminders** | High - "70% blood sugar reduction!" | Proprietary methodology, clinical value |
| **CGM Real-Time Sync** | Very High - "See glucose spike instantly!" | Future differentiator, tech-forward positioning |
| **Community Challenges** | Medium-High - "I'm competing with friends!" | Social engagement, viral growth |
| **Gamification (Badges/Streaks)** | Medium-High - "I unlocked a new badge!" | Fun, habit formation |
| **AI Meal Coach** | High - "It's like having a nutritionist 24/7!" | Personalization, ongoing support |
| **Restaurant Menu OCR** | Medium-High - "Just point camera at menu!" | Convenience, eating-out scenarios |
| **Sustainability Scoring** | Medium - "This meal saves 500g CO2!" | Values alignment (Gen Z/Millennials) |
| **Precision Nutrition** | Very High - "Based on MY biomarkers!" | Future-facing, premium positioning |

**INDIFFERENT (Low Priority)**

| Feature | Why Indifferent | Action |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| **Desktop App** | Mobile-first market | Skip - PWA on desktop sufficient |
| **Integration with Fitness Equipment** | Small user base (Peloton, etc.) | Defer - focus on wearables instead |
| **Podcast Integration** | Niche use case | Backlog |
| **Recipe Video Tutorials** | Content creation burden vs. value | Partner with influencers instead |

**REVERSE (May Cause Dissatisfaction)**

| Feature | Why Reverse | Mitigation |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Ads in Free Tier** | User frustration, premium positioning | Avoid ads; freemium model only |
| **Forced Social Sharing** | Privacy concerns | Make sharing optional, never forced |
| **Overly Complex Onboarding** | 77% abandon within 3 days | Minimal onboarding, progressive disclosure |
| **Too Many Push Notifications** | Annoyance, opt-outs | Smart timing, personalization, DND periods |
| **Mandatory Profile Picture** | Privacy, onboarding friction | Optional |

### 3.3 Kano Model Strategic Implications

**Prioritization Strategy:**
1. **Deliver all Basic Needs** (Month 0 - Launch) - Non-negotiable
2. **Optimize Performance Needs** (Months 0-12) - Competitive parity → advantage
3. **Introduce Delight Features** (Months 3-18) - Differentiation and word-of-mouth
4. **Avoid Reverse Features** (Always) - Preserve user trust and satisfaction

**Feature Rollout Sequence:**
- **Month 0:** Basic Needs complete (table stakes)
- **Months 1-3:** Quick Delight wins (voice logging, eating sequence reminders)
- **Months 3-6:** Performance optimization (accuracy, speed, database expansion)
- **Months 6-12:** Strategic Delight (gamification, community, CGM integration)
- **Months 12-24:** Future Delight (precision nutrition, AR, advanced AI)
